# RxJava-Countries

I made this little project as a way to learn about functional reactive programming using the RxJava framework and I use RetroFit as my
HTTP client. 

I wanted to learn how to make an asynchrounous backend in Java using the RxJava framework so I built a small HTTP client that will make
REST requests to [this countries api](https://restcountries.eu/). I wanted to learn how to make my rest calls on seperate threads, so I 
use the RxJava Schedulers to do so.
